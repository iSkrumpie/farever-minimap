# Farever Minimap & DPS

![Farever Minimap](minimap.gif)

A drop-in overlay for Farever (Shiro Games) with two tools in one DLL:

* **Minimap**: compass with a heading arrow, world mosaic underneath,
  and the POIs the game already knows about (obelisks, respawn
  points, dungeons, world activities, merchants).
* **DPS meter**: per-skill damage table with real in-game icons,
  fight history, and combat-state tracking. Only counts the damage
  numbers the game itself shows above mobs, so other party members
  and ambient world damage are out of the picture by construction.

## How to install

1. Grab the latest `.zip` from the [Releases page](../../releases).
2. Extract straight into your Farever folder, the one that contains
   `Farever.exe`. Typical Steam path:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Farever`.
   You should end up with `dinput8.dll` and a `data\` folder sitting
   next to the game's executable.
3. Launch Farever from Steam.

There is no injector. Windows resolves `dinput8.dll` from the game
folder before its own copy, so dropping the file next to
`Farever.exe` is enough. To uninstall, delete `dinput8.dll` and the
`data\` folder.

The overlay shows up a few seconds after the title screen, once
your character is loaded. It hides itself during loading screens
and zone transitions, and comes back as soon as the next player
Hero is spawned in the world.

## Controls

Default hotkeys (all rebindable in game, see below):

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F8  | Toggle the minimap |
| F10 | Toggle the DPS meter |
| F9  | Reset the current DPS pull |

To remap, click the small key icon on the minimap bezel. A
"Hotkeys" window pops up with three slots. Click a slot, press the
key you want, done. The binding is written to `data\keybinds.json`
so it persists across restarts. Esc cancels a rebind in progress.

The minimap bezel buttons, going around the rim:

* Pin: hold and drag to move the minimap around the screen
* Square: cycles three sizes (small, medium, large)
* Funnel: opens the POI filter panel
* Key: opens the hotkey rebind window
* Plus and Minus: zoom between roughly 10x and 20x
* Minus on top: shrinks the minimap to a small puck; click the puck
  to expand it again

The DPS window has the standard ImGui title-bar collapse arrow on
the left, so you can shrink it to just the title row when you want
it out of the way. Drag the title bar to move it.

## DPS meter

* **Real skill icons** for every class skill, weapon skill and
  basic attack. At the first damage event for each skill the mod
  reads the icon's atlas, cell coordinates and size out of the
  game's own data, then loads that atlas on demand. No per-class
  configuration needed.

* **Combat state** indicator next to the elapsed time. Red dot
  while in combat, grey dot when idle. The mod uses the game's own
  `isInCombat` flag, so dodging or blocking without dealing damage
  keeps the fight open instead of prematurely sealing it.

* **Fight history**: a collapsible block under the live table shows
  the last 10 sealed fights, with time, duration, total damage and
  DPS for each. Click a row to open a detail window with the full
  per-skill breakdown of that fight.

* **Responsive layout**: as you shrink the DPS window, columns
  drop progressively (Crit%, Max, Hits, Total, %). At the narrowest
  size you get just the icon and the DPS column.

* **Window positions persist** across sessions in
  `data\farever_layout.ini`. Drag your DPS and minimap wherever
  you like once; they will come back there next time.

## Troubleshooting

If the overlay starts hitching, F8 and F10 turn the two windows off
independently. The mod also auto-disables itself if it detects the
GPU stalling on the overlay for too long in a row, so you should
not need a game restart to recover from a bad transition.

If the minimap or DPS meter does not come back right after a
dungeon load, give it ten or fifteen seconds. The mod waits for
the new player Hero to spawn on the client and locks onto it as
soon as the allocation comes through, which on slow loads can take
a bit longer than the loading screen itself.

## Notes

The mod is read only. It reads your own player state out of the
game process and renders its own swap chain on top of Direct3D 12.
It does not write to game memory, it does not touch the network,
and it does not look at other players' positions or damage.

This is fan made and is not affiliated with Shiro Games. All
Farever assets remain the property of their respective owners; the
release zip bundles a subset of the game's UI textures and map
tiles for runtime display only.
